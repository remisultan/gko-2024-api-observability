= GKO 2024 - API Observability!

== Introduction

Make sure you are using python 3.10.x ()

Welcome to the API Observability Hackathon! üöÄ In this event, we'll explore the fascinating realm of vector embeddings and demonstrate how they can revolutionize an API platform !

*Challenge:* Implement an Observability API on different metrics of your web logs. Here are examples on how to do so:

- API centric:
 * Repartition of status code: Detect when irregular status codes happen
 * Payload size: Identify anomalous payload sizes
- User centric:
 * GeoIP: Extract features from IP addresses to detect anomalous calls
 * Devices: Identify from User-Agent

The goal is not to do everything but to learn and have fun !

*Data:*
Here is the link to the data you need to work with:

- Web Logs:
    * link:https://drive.google.com/uc?confirm=t&export=download&id=1m9Otzb-kh5SmyQOC-6tJEODy3UKoZaw2[Parquet Format]

To load the data with pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet("logs_df.parquet").sample(frac=1)
```

In order to extract informations from IPS
you will find here the MaxMind Databases you need

But before digging in, check out the tutorials below !

== Anomaly detection

In order to understand how to detect anomaly detection works, you can find the tutorial in this

== Time to shine !

Perfect! You are now a ML expert ! You know the drill, now make an awesome API, a fully-fledged app or integrate it to Gravitee.io directly !

You can find in this repository an example of REST API in Python Flask.

== Bonus

- Plug link:https://documentation.gravitee.io/ae/overview/readme[Alert Engine] to your application when an anomaly is detected

Get ready for an immersive and educational journey! Happy hacking! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
